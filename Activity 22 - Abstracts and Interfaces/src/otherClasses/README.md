# Unimplemented Classes
#### These are classes that may be in a final project but that did not make it into this one. They are mostly empty code written to prove and enable functionality of classes that are required.

---
## Restaurant
The implied restaurant to which all data (tables, orders, reservations, users, etc.) would be connected.

---
## Table
The tables in a restaurant as they are tracked in a digital environment. Used to track numbers of seats as well as which tables are reserved.

---
## Menu
A restaurant's menu contains food items, which are not included in this project. Staff can modify these, and customers cannot.

---
## Order
A restaurant's catalog of all orders, both current and past, are each stored in an Order object. Orderable items pertain to the menu, which has food items each with their own cost and prep time.

---
## Reservation
A restaurant's catalog of all reservations, both current and past, are each stored in a Reservation object. Reservations contain which tables are reserved and for how many people.
